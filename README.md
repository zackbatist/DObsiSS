DObsiSS
=======

The Database of Obsidian Sourcing Studies is a listing of chemically characterized archaeological obsidian, compiled from published journal articles, excavation reports, conference papers and other scholarly records. The database lists the amount of obsidian artefacts uncovered at sites in southwest Asia and Anatolia made from material derived from various volcanic sources based on geochemical analysis and comparison with geological samples.

Bringing all of the data together, archaeologists can reconstruct patterns of human movement and interaction on broad geographic and temporal scales. Hopefully this dataset may be put to other good uses as well. DObsiSS is expandable and new sourcing data will be added as it is generated; if anyone has any suggestions or modifications that they would like to propose, feel free to commit changes, fork the repository or contact me with any questions or concerns.

The database consists of multiple files that are organized in a purposeful way. CSV files hold tabular data and can be used for various statistical or relational analyses, among other functions. geoJSON files specify geographical elements of the dataset, and are easily imported into various GIS platforms. This file format is a fork of JSON, and is thus also very well suited for web-based visualizations. The JSON-LD files are used to integrate the dataset within a wider web of related information. Using Linked Open Data principles, each data field is explicitly associated with standard definitions or schemas, enabling others to determine whether the creators of different datasets share similar conceptions of the data they are tallying or recording. 

Aside from the primary dataset, a sub-directory will eventually include information about the obsidian sources in the region. A machine readable bibliographic index is also in the works. 

This database is being actively maintained and new information is incorporated as it becomes available. However sourcing data that is pending publication is omitted until it is readily accessible.
